#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)  O(n^3), outcome of input increases to the power of 3 


b)  O(n log n), the outer loop is in O(n) while inner loop divides in half


c)  O(n), outcome of input increases proportionately

## Exercise II

Using a Binary Search we would start at the middle and drop an egg. 
If the egg breaks all the higher floors don't count.
Start moving lower until we find the floor where the egg don't break.

O(log n), the output divides in half each time
